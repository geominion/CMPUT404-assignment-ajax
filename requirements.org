* Explore using AJAX to make a shared state interactive application
** Description

   Your task is to fill in the blanks and connect your browser to your
   webservice via AJAX. We won't be using XML here unless you want
   to. I recommend JSON.

   Your task is to get this shared drawing program to work using AJAX.

   This program allows numerous clients to connect and draw on the
   same surface and share the drawing they have made with anyone who
   is currently on.

   The goal here is for you to understand the very basics of AJAX,
   learn a little about canvas, learn a little bit about the overhead
   of AJAX, learn about JSON and other technologies. Also you'll get
   to learn about the flask micro-framework.

** Collaboration
   - You may consult with others but the submission should be your
     own source code.
   - You may work (pair program) with 1 other person, but both of you
     need to submit your work separately.
   - Collaboration must be documented in the README.md file
   - Any external source code must be referenced and documented in
     the README.md file

** User Stories
   - As a web browser user I want to draw on the canvas
   - As a web browser user I want to see others drawing on the canvas
   - As a web browser user I want the system to be responsive to my
     actions (< 100ms)
   - As a web browser user I want to watch as other users draw on the
     canvas
   - As a web service user I want to get access to the world
   - As a web service user I want to post entities that have at least
     'x' and 'y' co-ordinates
   - As a web service user I will probably ping the system a lot to
     get updates.

** Requirements

   - [ ] Implement the AJAX Javascript parts in the HTML file static/index.htm
   - [ ] Implement the webservice root
   - [ ] Implement the webservice /entity/entity-name POST/PUT/GET API

   - [ ] Implement the webservice /clear API
   - [ ] Use JSON or XML to communicate (no plain text!)
   - [ ] The webservice can pass all the tests in freetests.py
   - [ ] The webservice can serve /static/index.html
   - [ ] static/index.html displays the current state of the webservice
   - [ ] static/index.html responds to clicks within 100ms on average
